# MA415-Final-Project-NBA-3-Pointer-Analysis

There are 15 big csv files about the shot data every player in every game in recent 15 NBA regular seasons that I generate from NBA APIs. They can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l0D1ex3b1QHpy4MXbYrs3otOo8Pfsjxb. 

I can't publish the shiny of my final project because of some unsolved problem, so I use the default shiny example in RStudio to practice how to publish a shiny file on shinyapp.io.         https://minziran.shinyapps.io/pract/

To see the shiny of my final project, please download this repository and run file Shiny.R locally. Thanks!
