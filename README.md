# MA415-Final-Project-NBA-3-Pointer-Analysis

Summary:\
• Collected and manipulated the data of every single shot attempted in every NBA game in recent 15 years from NBA Stats API, and discovered relationship between team seasonal winning percentage and number of 3 pointers\
• Transformed JSON data to cleanable CSV format, visualized shooting data by designing player shot charts and time series graphs of team winnings and 3 pointers made, and conducted correlation test in R


Note:\
There are 15 big csv files about the shot data every player in every game in recent 15 NBA regular seasons that I generate from NBA APIs. They can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l0D1ex3b1QHpy4MXbYrs3otOo8Pfsjxb. 

I can't publish the shiny of my final project because of some unsolved problem, so I use the default shiny example in RStudio to practice how to publish a shiny file on shinyapp.io.         https://minziran.shinyapps.io/pract/ 

To see the shiny of my final project, please download this repository and run file Shiny.R locally.\
You can also just open the folder "Shiny in a folder" to run my Shiny Application
